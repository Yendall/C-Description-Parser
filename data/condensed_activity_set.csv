这里根据您居住的远近，或是乘车地点而定），首先我们将游览的是奥克兰著名的皇后大街，皇后大街上汇集着各式各样的店铺，对于爱购物或是爱逛街的朋友是个非常不错的选择。其次我们将徒步到lorne st 和 st，这里处处散发出时尚的气息，众多的时尚品牌，特色美食也都暗藏在街头巷尾，我将会带您一起去探索。 接着我们将前往奥克兰的港口，为何奥克兰又名为千帆之都 ，这里必然有他的玄机所在，跟随着脚步我将为您一一道来。辗转反侧我们将来到奥克兰市区公园维多利亚公园，这里有一些独具特色的 fish market，我们可以一同前往，去了解生活在这里的人们是如何选取美味的海鲜。最后也是本次游览的终极目的地，我们会前往新西兰著名地标天空塔，我会为您介绍它那些不为人知的故事。"," 位于新西兰北岛怀卡地区的玛塔玛塔镇 matamata，周围绿草如茵的牧场被演绎成了中土世界的世外桃源——夏尔地区（the shire）。电影中这里是霍比特人的美丽家园，比尔博正是从这里出发踏上了探险之旅。目前的霍比特村有44个霍比特人洞穴，每个洞屋的设计都独具匠心，必须由当地的导游带领才能进村参观。 进入霍比特村，在连绵青翠的山坡上，半圆形的霍比特人洞穴小屋“镶嵌”在半山腰里，错落有致。穿过小河，走过拱桥，路过水车滚滚转动的磨坊，就来到了绿龙酒馆（the dragon）。酒馆完全还原了电影中的样貌，茅草屋顶，泥巴和石头砌成的墙壁，朴实的木头桌椅。一切都是那么的熟悉与真实，令你仿佛走进了电影里。 怀托摩萤火虫洞是新西兰最负盛名的萤火虫洞之一，是隐藏于怀托摩地区之下的神奇的地下世界。这里有梦幻般的萤火虫洞穴、形态各异的钟乳石、无数的地下河和流水洞，在45分钟的游览中，您将慢慢探索其中的奥秘。"," start journey between 11am 2pm leaves enough galleries before 5pm introduce interesting places eat

eight）的核心盟校成员，国际著名研究型大学联盟组织环太平洋大学联盟、亚太国际贸易教育暨研究联盟（paciber）的成员大学之一。每当考试季节，主楼的考试树就会盛开紫色的花朵，分外美丽。悉尼大学（the university sydney）有165年的历史了，听着这个数字，就让人心生敬畏。一百多年的历史长河中，悉尼大学的校友中产生了三位联邦大法官、六位澳大利亚总理、联合国大会主席、世行行长以及三分之一的澳洲诺贝尔奖得主，飞机上必备的黑匣子、现在全世界各地每天在使用的wifi，都是悉尼大学的专利发明。 景点2：校园内的木乃伊博物馆30mins50mins 悉尼大学有多个久负盛名的博物馆，包括macleay museum 、nicholson museum 和university art gallery，其中的nicholson博物馆内收藏了许多古埃及、古希腊和古罗马的珍贵文物，包括许多世界级珍宝。学校的博物馆常年对外开放，可以免费参观游览。 景点3：悉尼大学图书馆20mims 是南半球最大的大学图书馆，占第53000平方米，有多个部分组成，中心的流通线将建筑分开，新老建筑的结合，交通流线清晰。现在的fisher图书馆已成为悉尼大学图书馆的主馆，拥有馆藏印刷型文献500余万册、计算机书目记录140余万条、250余个电子文献资源数据库、54000余种电子期刊，为学校教学科研活动提供了极为丰富的信息资源。悉尼大学图书馆为本校用户向其它图书馆或文献供应商索取本馆未收藏的文献，主要服务对象是悉尼大学的教职员工、研究生、博士生和高年级需要写作毕业论文的本科生。图书馆24小时开放，如果有学生的账号，可以使用免费wifi，全校全网覆盖。 景点4：悉尼大学所谓的“校门”（走路10mins） 普普通通的大门，掩映在古朴的大树丛中，一点也不起眼，但是就是从这里，走出了那么多政界、商界、金融、科技的领袖人物。一百多年的校训“繁星纵变，智慧永恒”见证着辉煌和永恒。 景点5：悉尼大学餐厅吃饭40mins 这有世界各地的美食，你也能领略到世界各地的人种齐聚餐厅。像是开联合国大会一样。当然，这里最最最多的当然是中国人的身影。剩余时间游览整个校园。"," tour highlights… view zealand’s parliament buildings beehive hop off visit saint paul’s cathedral wander wellington botanic
