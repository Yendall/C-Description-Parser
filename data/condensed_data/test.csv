Camper Trailer Tour on the Mornington Peninsular Travelling in a camper-trailer may be a new experience  it is however  one of the greatest ways to explore the many natural wonders of Australia. The mobility of a camping vehicle allows you to set up camp almost anywhere you like  without needing to locate a clear and level space. This also allows us to avoid the often arduous process of securing a conventional tent to the ground. Camping in a trailer also allows an elevated sleeping platform  to avoid any undesirable pests and wildlife interference. This is a useful asset when traveling with children also.  Our various activities will include: * Sleeping overnight in a comfortable camper trailer * Arthur's Seat Outlooks * Visiting a Winery cellar * Swimming and surfing at Sorrento Beach * Seasonal fruit picking    10511

Daintree River Morning Tour Morning tours usually start in the brackish portion of the river and go down stream into the saltier portion of the river (the mangrove delta). Going where other tour boats rarely go because of their lack of time and being hindered by their canopy clearance. The tour goes well back into creeks to see one of the most diverse mangrove forests in the world.   You will clearly see the transition of the brackish-water mangroves to the sea-water mangroves as we poke around the various islands and creeks of the delta. Crocodiles are almost always seen on this tour (providing it is not during a very high tide). We usually see bird species that are unique to the mangroves in addition to the many species that can also be seen in places outside of the mangroves. The main boat  `Nightwatchman` is 6 metres long with an open top and very comfortable 360 degree swivel seats. The swivel seats allow you to turn to see `the action` rather than sitting shoulder to shoulder on a bench seat. Nightwatchman's shallow draft allows a much closer approach to things of interest. Its wide beam also gives it great stability.  Dan Irby's Mangrove Adventure Tours are different from other Daintree River Tours. Most other river tours are primarily a one-hour `See a Crocodile` tour. A Dan Irby's Mangrove Adventure Tour will let you discover all of what the Daintree River has to offer.  And best of all your tour guide Dan Irby personally conducts all the tours. Dan has been conducting tours on the Daintree River for over 15 years and has the experience to help you get most out of your Daintree River experience. 11481
Daintree River Afternoon Tour These tours are essentially the same as the Morning Tours in that both usually take place in the mangrove delta.  Sometimes this is preferred time-slot instead of the Morning Tour because of a more favourable tide or perhaps it may be at more convenient time. It is generally taken when people want to take the day-portion of the Combination Tour (see below).  Late afternoon is when the bunches of Pied Imperial Pigeons start flying back to their nests and mate on the off-shore islands (when they are in summer residence here).  This is when the birds start to become more active as the temperature begins to drop away from the hotter temperatures of mid-day. The main boat  `Nightwatchman` is 6 metres long with an open top and very comfortable 360 degree swivel seats. The swivel seats allow you to turn to see `the action` rather than sitting shoulder to shoulder on a bench seat. Nightwatchman's shallow draft allows a much closer approach to things of interest.

Daintree River Evening/Spotlighting Tour On a clear night when we look skyward  it is very common to see satellites  meteorites or `falling` stars and such an array of stars that can only be seen in the rare conditions of clean air and no city-light pollution. It is difficult to describe in words the exhilaration of slowly floating along a tropical river as day turns to night.  As the birds are flying to their roosts  the fruit bats begin to disperse to feed and the night creatures start their nocturnal choruses. With a spotlight  birds  reptiles and frogs can be approached to within an arm's length (a bird watcher's and photographer's dream come true). The main boat  `Nightwatchman` is 6 metres long with an open top and very comfortable 360 degree swivel seats. The swivel seats allow you to turn to see `the action` rather than sitting shoulder to shoulder on a bench seat. Nightwatchman's shallow draft allows a much closer approach to things of interest.
