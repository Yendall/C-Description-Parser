"Melbourne's Historical Architecture Walk Through this experience you will uncover the past of the city much of which is hidden in plain sight. It would be a pleasure to show others the place I call home. I'm a Melbourne local born and bred. Outside of my work as a coffee consultant my passion lies with Melbourne's historical buildings. Together we will explore Melbourne as it is today and understand it's past. We can start off with a coffee in one of Melbourne's renowned cafes before trekking off on foot or by tram. I will share the unknown stories behind some of my favorite architecture and how they transformed Melbourne into the amazing place that it is today. We will firstly explore famous lane ways then spend some time exploring the political and governmental side of the city. We will then move through China Town on our way past famous older buildings on our way to a heritage listed arcade. We'll finally arrive at an exciting spot where many locals visit for coffee and a range of interesting local foods. 10261"
