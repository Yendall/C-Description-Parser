1. ~~Condense description down to meaningful words using filters~~
2. Run Inverse Category Frequency on word sets against keyword vectors for each category
3. Cluster the data based on Inverse Category Frequency results with K-Means
4. Observe currently labelled data with high-frequency in category
5. Automatically tag the unlabelled data to the same tag as the closest (Euclidean Distance) similar labelled node
