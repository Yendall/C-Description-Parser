1. Condense description down to meaningful words using filters (80% complete)
2. Add new column to dataset of condensed description
3. Run through frequency vector to see which words are meaningful
4. Cluster the data based on common words
5. Find labelled data with those common words
6. Automatically tag the unlabelled data to the same tag as the closest similar labelled node
