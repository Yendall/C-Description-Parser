TODO:
------
1. Condense data down to meaningful words using filters and output the data into new condense_files ✓
2. Create vectors with combined words from the data set for each field. ✓
3. Compute the Cosine Similarity between data sets ✓
4. Normalize the Cosine Similarity and cluster it as a distance metric ✓
5. Tag untagged data based on Cosine Distance Metric
